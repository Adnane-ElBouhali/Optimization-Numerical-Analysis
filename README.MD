# Optimization and Numerical Analysis

This repository contains practical works completed as part of the MDI210 "Optimisation et analyse numérique" course at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

The course MDI210 "Optimisation et analyse numérique" covers two main parts:

1. Continuous Optimization Methods
2. Numerical Analysis Problems

The course aims to provide methods for solving continuous optimization problems and addresses classical problems in numerical analysis.

## Practical Works

This repository includes two practical works that apply the concepts learned in the course:

### 1. Simplex Method

- **File**: `Main.java`
- **Description**: This practical work focuses on implementing the simplex method for linear programming problems.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Modeling a dictionary using Java classes
  - Implementing methods for feasibility checking, variable selection, and pivoting
  - Handling various types of linear programming problems (bounded, unbounded, degenerate)

### 2. Descent Method

- **File**: `Main.java`
- **Description**: This practical work involves implementing a descent method for minimizing a convex function over a domain defined by linear constraints.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Implementing methods for direction finding in the interior, on the boundary, and at corners of the domain
  - Using dichotomy for line search
  - Implementing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions
  - Visualizing the descent trajectory and gradient vectors

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (preferably JDK 11)
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse)
4. Run the main methods in each practical work file to see the implementations in action

## Note

These practical works are part of the educational curriculum at Télécom Paris and are intended for learning purposes. The implementations demonstrate the application of optimization and numerical analysis concepts learned in the MDI210 course.
